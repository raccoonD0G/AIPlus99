PPO 시에 발생하는 메모리 문제를 해결하기 위해 Flash Attention, LoRA, Quantization(8bit) 을 적용하였다. 이후 추가로 발생하는 메모리 문제에 대해서는 Partial PPO 로 대응하였다. 그 결과 코드 특화 모델이 아닌 Qwen1.5-0.5B 를 코드 생성기로 튜닝하는 것에 성공하였다.\n","\n","\n","## 서론\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","Unreal Engine 5는 자신만의 C++ 문법을 사용하고 있다. 따라서 C++ STL 과 다른 언리얼 만의 매크로, 코드 포맷을 정확히 숙지해야 한다. 이번 과제에서는 Qwen1.5-0.5B 처럼 작은 모델도 이러한 문법을 학습할 수 있는지 실험해보고자 하였다.\n","\n","학습에는 Supervised Fine-Tuning(SFT), Generative Adversarial Network(GAN), Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO) 등의 기법이 적용되었다.\n","\n","\n","## 방법\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","본 과제에서 사용된 학습 파이프라인은 두 가지 주요 단계로 구성된다: SFT, GAN & PPO 이다.\n","\n","1. SFT\n","\n","  초기 단계에서는 Unreal Engine 관련 C++ 헤더 및 구현 파일을 포함한 데이터셋을 사용해 Qwen1.5-0.5B를 감독 학습 방식으로 튜닝하였다. 이 과정은 기본적인 문법, 스타일, Unreal 전용 키워드(UCLASS, GENERATED_BODY 등)의 사용 습관을 모델에 학습시키는 것을 목표로 했다.\n","\n","  해당 학습은 1160 개의 데이터를 batch_size 8 로 3 epoch 학습시켰다. 한 epoch 당 소요 시간은 약 4분이었다.\n","\n","  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qLR4PgoErmPj2PCgydMt7dmdFaooByIx#scrollTo=ES4t0TPwQCvi\n","\n","2. GAN & PPO\n","\n","  SFT 이후, Generator로서의 Qwen 모델과 Discriminator 모델을 구성하여 GAN & PPO 훈련을 수행하였다. Generator는 Unreal 코드 샘플을 생성하고, Discriminator는 그것이 GPT-4o 로 생성한 것인지 여부를 판단한다. 판단 결과는 PPO 로직을 통해 Generator 를 학습시킨다.\n","  \n","  보상 함수는 코드 포맷 준수 패널티와 Discriminator 의 판단 결과로 구성되었다. 이 과정에서 발생하는 VRAM 과부하 문제를 해결하기 위해 FlashAttention과 8bit 양자화, LoRA를 활용하였다. 또한 Gradient Memory를 줄이기 위해 Partial PPO를 도입하였다.\n","\n","  여기서 말하는 Partial PPO 란, PPO 를 위한 토큰의 기울기 저장을, 전체 토큰이 아닌 일부 토큰에서만 진행한다는 것이다. 예를 들어 총 512 개의 생성 토큰 중 앞 320 개의 토큰과, 나머지 토큰중 10% 의 토큰에 대해서만 기울기를 저장한다. 모든 토큰의 기울기를 저장하는 것에 비해 학습의 수렴 속도가 늦어지겠지만, 학습시 VRAM 피크를 크게 낮출 수 있다. 이 덕분에 기존에는 불가능 하던 PPO 학습을 코랩 환경에서 진행시킬 수 있었다.\n","\n","  해당 학습은 1160 개의 데이터를 batch_size 2 로 0.2 epoch 학습시켰다. 한 epoch 당 소요 시간은 약 41시간 이었다.\n","\n","\n","## 모델 구조\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","Generator : Qwen1.5-0.5B, input 1024 tokens, output 512 tokens\n","\n","Discriminator : Qwen1.5-0.5B, input : 512 tokens, output : 1 logit\n","\n","Value Head : microsoft/codebert-base\n","\n","\n","## 실험\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","모델의 성능 평가를 위해 90 개의 requirement, header_code, cpp_code 를 추가로 생성했다. 평가 지표는 아래와 같다.\n","\n","1.
